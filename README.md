# beginner-programming-resources
A collection of some helpful resources for beginner programmers.

Some things to include here:
* Wanna see if programming is your thing before investing time in real languages?
  * Try and find the little coding games that help teach some of the basics - loops, conditionals, etc.
* Setting up Python environment (the real deal)
  * Find some youtube videos or articles that talk about setting it up (downloading and installing Python, downloading and installing VS Code, Python extension, etc.)
* Python tutorial videos
* Need some syntax help?
  * Web3, Geeks4Geeks, Python documentation, ChatGPT or other AI can be helpful most of the time (but take what they say with a grain of salt)
  * Phanon? Idk if it is available to everyone or not...
* MIT (or was it Harvard?) free courses 

# TODO: Remove these demo parts
* Maybe get a poster and write on it - Programming or beginner programming?
* Print off a QR code that people can scan that directs them to this repo

Some of the things I'll have for demos (hopefully):
* Big Blue is You
* Maze Game
* Turtle program in a while loop
* Poem generator (if I feel like setting up Java)
* Turtle - circle rectangle thingy
* Maybe make a CLI to interact with all of the demos so they can choose what they want to do? Or a webpage???
