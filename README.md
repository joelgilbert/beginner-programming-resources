# Beginner Programming Resources (Particularly Python)
A collection of some helpful resources for beginner programmers.

## Wanna see if programming is your thing before investing time in the real deal?
Code Combat is a website that allows you to learn some of the basics of coding through a game. If you want to see if coding might be your jam before going through the effort of setting up your coding environment, check out Code Combat!
To get going, do the following:
* Go to [Code Combat](https://codecombat.com/)
* Click the button, "I'm a Student"
* Click "Play Now" since there isn't a class code
* Click the "Play" button under "Kithgard Dungeon"
* Follow the on screen instructions and enjoy! I'd recommend leaving the defaults (so Python for the language). If you enjoy it, you're welcome to create an account to better track your progress. 
## Python Courses/Tutorials
There are a lot of different resources out there to learn Python. I've included a few here that you might find useful, but feel free to peruse the interwebs for additional resources if desired.
  * [Python Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5KVEU3aaeQ) - a video course that is about 2 hours, but seems pretty decent at explaining different concepts, including the setup of your Python environment.
  * [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) - a tutorial you can read through and follow along with
  * [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language-tutorial/) - another tutorial you can read through and follow along with
## Need some syntax help?
After working through the courses/tutorials and you find you don't remember the syntax or arguments for a particular data sctructure or function, some of the following resources might be useful:
  * Honestly, a Google search can be very helpful.
  * ChatGPT or other AI tools can be beneficial most of the time, but take their output with a grain of salt. I've seen them make some interesting (but wrong!) hallucinations.
  * The tutorial links from above for W3Schools and Geeks for Geeks are also great for refreshers.
## Ready for more Computer Science and programming concepts?
MIT provides hundreds of [free online courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/)! They have several Computer Science courses that you could take to continue to level up your programming journey.

# TODO: Remove these demo parts
* Maybe get a poster and write on it - Programming or beginner programming?
* Print off a QR code that people can scan that directs them to this repo

Some of the things I'll have for demos (hopefully):
* Big Blue is You
* Maze Game
* Turtle program in a while loop
* Poem generator (if I feel like setting up Java)
* Turtle - circle rectangle thingy
* Maybe make a CLI to interact with all of the demos so they can choose what they want to do? Or a webpage???
